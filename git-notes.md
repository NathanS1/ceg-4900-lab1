### Git notes
For those of you trying to make your own github pen-testing suite, the
following notes will (hopefully) make your time using git less painful
(and even possibly fun).

First, check out [the Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) written by
Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.  The entire book is online and a great reference
for both new git users trying to learn the ropes and command line wizards
trying to automate their coffee pots based on the number of frustrated git
commits per hour.

If you are completely new to git, skim/read the first three chapters of Pro Git
and check out [the git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial).  The 
tutorial is fat paced to refer back to the Pro Git book as necessary.

Finally, Git is a tool for collaboration.  There is no right way to use said
tool, but there are plenty of wrong ways ;)  Expect to mess things up at first.

To help speed things along, check out [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams.
This is one of the most helpful reads in learning how to use Git properly.

Once you have mastered writing good commits its time to create a great 
`README.md`.  The markdown format `.md` is way to style text on the web.
[Github has their own slightly unique markdown syntaxt](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), 
but any old [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#emphasis) will help.

Finally, the best feature of git is arguably branches, but figuring out the 
best branching workflow requires a good bit of experience and trial and error.
Check out the [Git Flow model](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) also written about by the author, [Vincent Driessen here.](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
